Titanic Survival Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to explore factors affecting survival rates. Using Python and pandas, I performed data cleaning, exploration, and statistical analysis.

Key Questions Explored
1.What percentage of passengers survived?
2.Was survival related to gender?
3.Did passenger class affect survival?
4.Was age a factor in survival?
5.Effect of family size on survival.

Technologies Used
Python
pandas
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

How to Run
Clone the repo
Open main.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
Run all cells to see the analysis

Insights / Summary
About X% of passengers survived.
Females had a higher survival rate than males.
Passengers in 1st class had the highest survival rate.
Average age of survivors was slightly lower than non-survivors.
Family size did not show a strong correlation with survival.

Dataset
The dataset is from Kaggle Titanic Dataset.
